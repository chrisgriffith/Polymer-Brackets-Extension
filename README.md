# Polymer-Brackets-Extension
A Brackets code hinting extension for the Polymer project [www.polymer-project.org/] (www.polymer-project.org/).

## Notice
 There's a known issue with Brackets that keeps multiple code hinters from being run at the same time. Therefore, for this extension to work, make sure you have no other code hinters installed. 
 
## Install

1. Install Brackets 1.0 or later.
2. In Brackets, click the menu item File > Extension Manager...
3. Go to the "Available" tab of the dialog that appears.
4. Type "Polymer code hinter" in the search box.
5. Click the "Install" button in the search result for Polymer Project Code Hinter.
